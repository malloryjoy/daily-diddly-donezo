// Given an array of five numbers, each representing the time (in seconds) it took a luger to complete a segment of a track, determine which segment had the fastest speed and what that speed was.

// The track is divided into the following segments:

// Segment 1: 320 meters
// Segment 2: 280 meters
// Segment 3: 350 meters
// Segment 4: 300 meters
// Segment 5: 250 meters
// The first value in the given array corresponds to the time for segment 1, the second value to segment 2, and so on.

// To calculate the speed (in meters per second) for a segment, divide the distance by the time.

// Return "The luger's fastest speed was X m/s on segment Y.". Where X is the fastest speed, rounded to two decimal places, and Y is the segment number where the fastest speed occurred.
